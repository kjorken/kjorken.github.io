I helped with building, customizing, maintenance, and deployment; my client is mainly the one maintaining these sites. Themes are adapted from existing designs or built from Figma mockups, with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) and full WordPress integration (custom post types, theme options, plugin compatibility).
