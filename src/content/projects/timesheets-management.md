This is a minimum viable product (MVP) developed during my internship at Jairosoft. Built as an internal company web application, it demonstrates rapid prototyping, full-stack thinking, and solving real-world business problems for employee time management and billing.

**Note:** This was an internal company tool with no public deployment. However, the experience and learnings from building this system were invaluable.
