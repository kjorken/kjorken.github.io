This project demonstrates deep understanding of low-level systems programming through direct assembly language development. It covers fundamental concepts in computer architecture, memory management, and performance optimization at the CPU instruction level.

## Project Overview

The assembly project provides hands-on experience with x86-64 architecture, including:
- Direct CPU instruction programming
- System call interfacing
- Memory and register management
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Debugging complex system-level code

## Key Features

- x86-64 assembly programming with Intel/AT&T syntax
- System call interfacing (Linux syscalls)
- Memory management techniques (stack, heap, registers)
- Performance optimization strategies
- Register allocation and management
- Inline assembly integration with C
- Debugging and profiling of low-level code

## Learning Objectives Covered

- Understanding CPU architecture and instruction sets
- Stack and calling conventions
- Function prologue/epilogue
- System call mechanisms
- Performance measurement and optimization
- Security implications of low-level programming
- Compiler output analysis

## Technologies Used

- Language: x86-64 Assembly (Intel and AT&T syntax)
- C for wrapper code and testing
- Assembler: NASM and GAS (GNU Assembler)
- Linker: GNU ld
- Debugger: GDB for low-level debugging
- Profiler: perf for performance analysis
- Reference: Intel Software Developer Manual
