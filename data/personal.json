	"bio": "I'm a Web Developer focused on building responsive, performant websites and web applications. My work spans from vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites to modern frameworks like Astro and React, always prioritizing clean code and user experience. Currently, I freelance on custom web development projects including static sites with Mapbox integration, WordPress theme customization from Figma designs, and website maintenance with blog content generation and multi-language localization for international audiences. My primary client is OneJourney Tours, where I handle website development, blog content generation with AI assistance, and multi-language localizations across 10+ languages to drive organic search traffic. Beyond development, I have hands-on experience with project management, QA testing, database design, and technical documentation. I hold industry certifications in Network Security, Java, and Databases from Certiport.",
